Enhanced cross platform development with MVVM and Web tools


This project is part of the unfinished Master’s Thesis of Valentin Rock.

The project uses the MVVM structure to enhance many aspects of the cross platform development process with web technologies. This sample implementation of a cross platform solution will describe many problems that appear when cross developing a larger application and will show how to fix them. 
The application itself is a simple sopping list that is only partly implemented to show critical scenarios of cross platform development. The application uses a simple self-created MVVM implementation to provide the base structure for our application. KnockoutJs is used as a solid binding framework to connect our Views with the ViewModels.

A link to the finished document that will describe and analyze this sample project as well as another project developed with .NET technologies will be published here in the future.
